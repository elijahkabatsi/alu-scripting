# Reddit API Advanced

## Project Overview
This project explores how to interact programmatically with the **Reddit API** using Python.  
It focuses on retrieving data from Reddit endpoints, handling JSON responses, recursion, and sorting data from APIs.

By the end of this project, you’ll be able to:
- Read API documentation and identify useful endpoints.
- Handle pagination in APIs.
- Parse JSON responses.
- Perform recursive API queries.
- Sort dictionaries by values.
- Follow RESTful and PEP 8 coding standards.

- How to read API documentation to find the endpoints you’re looking for.
- How to use an API with pagination.
- How to parse JSON results from an API.
- How to make a recursive API call.
